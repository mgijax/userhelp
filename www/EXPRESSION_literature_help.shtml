<h3><a id="whatis"></a>What can I use this query form to find?</h3>
<p>The Gene Expression Literature Query Form allows you to query for references that include data on endogenous gene expression in the mouse.  The Gene Expression Database (GXD) curators create content records that contain information on the genes and ages analyzed and assay types used in each reference; the query form queries these content records.  To the best of our knowledge, all publications containing embryonic expression data from 1993 to the present for all pertinent journals, and from 1990 to the present for the major development journals, have content records.  However, expression assays using knock-in reporter genes have only been included in the content records since May 2002.  Curators add content records to GXD weekly.

<h3><a id="summary"></a>How do I interpret the query results?</h3>
<p>Gene Expression Literature queries return a summary of search criteria matches.  Each record appears in two areas: at the top of the page in the <a href="#irbaa">Summary by Age and Assay</a> table and in the <a href="#irbgr">Summary by Gene and Reference</a> listing.
</p>
<p>A <i>content record</i> is created for each gene whose expression is analyzed in a reference. The details in a record are called the <i>results</i>. Each result reports the assay type used and the age of the specimen analyzed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content records contain one or more results.</li>
<li>The number of records matching the search criteria and the number of references they were derived from appears at the top of the query summary.  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="aiqrs"></a>Ways of accessing Gene Expression Literature Results</h4>
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><th>If you access a summary from ...</th><th>a box at the top displays the ... </th></tr>
<tr><td>Reference details</td><td>Reference and its J number (linked to the full reference record)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Marker details</td><td>Symbol of the gene whose expression results are being summarized (linked to the marker detail record) and its name</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gene Expression Data Query Results</td><td>Parameters used to generate the query (supplied either from a query form or from a referring page)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Links within the Summary by Age and Assay table</td><td>Assay type and age of the chosen link</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<h4><a id="irbaa"></a>Summary by Age and Assay</h4>
<p>The Summary by Age and Assay table groups search criteria matches according to the age of the specimen analyzed and the assay type used for the analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>E</b> is the abbreviation for embryonic.  An E without a subsequent number indicates a reference with embryonic expression analysis where the exact age of the tissue was unreported.</li>
<li><b>P</b> is the abbreviation for Postnatal and indicates that postnatal expression was analyzed.</li>
<li>The numbers in the columns are linked to result details.
   <ul>
   <li> If the number is 1, it links directly to the detail record. </li>
   <li> If the number is greater than 1, it links to a summary result, grouped by gene and reference, where you can follow links to additional details.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4><a id="irbgr"></a>Summary by Gene and Reference</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>This listing groups results from matching content records by gene. </li>
  <li>It includes the citation of the reference the results were reported in. </li>
  <li>The number of results matching the search criteria is linked to a detail record.</li>
  <li>If the results are also included in the detailed expression portion of the database, an asterisk appears after the number of results. </li>
  </ul>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em;"><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

<h3><a id="detail"></a>How do I interpret Gene Expression Literature Detail results?</h3>

<p>Links to subsequent details contain table listings of the symbol and name of the assayed gene (linked to the marker details), and the citation and J number of the expression results reference (linked to the full reference record). Then, if the reference has in depth annotations, the phrase <b>Detailed expression data for these assays</b> and the number of results appears, linked to the summary pages.</p>

<p>The lower portion represents expression information about the gene in the reference. A red ball indicates the assay types used and the ages analyzed; each ball represents a result. Whenever possible, the age annotations are normalized according to the following conventions: noon of the day on which the vaginal plug is found is counted as embryonic (E) day 0.5. Therefore, e.g., if an author refers to the day on which the plug is found as E0, we add 0.5 to the age value(s) listed in the paper and the comment <i>Age normalized so that noon of plug day = E0.5</i> to the record. If the staging criteria are not described in the paper, we annotate to the ages given by the authors and may add the comment <i>Age of embryo at noon of plug day not specified in reference</i> to the record. </p>

<p>In addition to specific age values, two general annotations are used:
<blockquote>

<table >
   <tr><td><b>E</b></td><td>Embryonic expression analyzed, exact age of tissue not specified in reference</td></tr>
   <tr><td><b>P</b></td><td>Postnatal (includes adult) expression analyzed.</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p> Any comments the curator feels are necessary to interpret the record appear at the bottom of the page. <b>Note:</b> As indicated on the detail page, the record denotes only that a gene was assayed for, using a particular assay type, and does not indicate whether or not gene expression was detected.</p>
