<h3>How do I interpret this report?</h3>

<ul>
 <li>If there are expression data about a marker in the Gene Expression Database, the word <i>Tissues</i>, followed by a number, appears in the Expression section of the Gene Detail page.  Clicking that number presents a table of all anatomical structures in the database examined when analyzing the gene expression pattern. The symbol and name of the gene whose expression was analyzed as well as its MGI accession ID appears at the top of the table.</li>
 <!--<li>If there are expression data from a reference in the Gene Expression Database, the word <i>Tissues</i>, preceded by a number, appears in the Additional Information section of References Query Results - Details. Clicking <i>Tissues</i> presents a table of all anatomical structures examined when analyzing gene expression in this reference.  The J: number link  to the reference followed by the full list citation appears at the top of the table. </li>-->
 <li>You can export your results in text or spreadsheet formats.</li>

<tr><th align="left" valign="top"><b>+</b></th><td valign="top">Number of times expression was detected in the structure. This column also include specimens for which detected = ambiguous or not specified (as well as present).
<P>Note: Present appears if expression is reported as detected but the author did not specify the level. Not specified is used when the authors do not report whether a gel band is present or absent. Ambiguous is used when the curators cannot discern from the authorsâ€™ description whether expression is present or absent.</p> </td></tr>
