<H3><a id="how_assoc"></a>How are gene to disease associations made?</H3>
<p>Human disease associations to human genes are from the NCBI mim2gene_medgen file and include annotations from OMIM and NCBI. Human disease associations to mouse genes are from MGI curated data and are only made when the genotype of at least one mouse model allows for a clear gene to disease relationship to be determined. </p>
