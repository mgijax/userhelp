<h3><A name="whatpurpose"></a>What is the purpose of the Gene Expression Database?</h3>
<p>The Gene Expression Database (GXD) is designed to integrate many different types of endogenous gene expression data from the mouse in formats appropriate for comprehensive analysis.   Query results, such as the developmental stage and tissue of expression (or non-expression), the genetic origin of the sample, and the numbers and sizes of detected bands, are described together with the molecular probe, the expression assay type, and the experimental conditions used.  Expression patterns are described using an extensive, hierarchical dictionary of standardized anatomical terms, making it possible to record expression results from assays with differing spatial resolution in a consistent and integrated manner and to analyze expression patterns at differing levels of detail. Whenever possible, text annotations are complemented by digitized images of the original expression data.
<p>To learn more about GXD and how we acquire data, please see
<a href="<!--#include file='include/mgihome_url.html'-->/GXD/aboutGXD.shtml" target="_blank">About GXD</a>.
</p>
<p>See also the <a href="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->glossary" target="_blank">MGI Glossary</a> for unfamiliar terms and acronyms.</p>

<h3><A name="whatquery"></a>What can I use the Gene Expression Data query form to find?</h3>
<p>The Gene Expression Data Query form Standard Search tab allows you to ask questions that can be basic or complex. Examples of the type of questions you can ask are:
 <ul>
  <li>When and where is <b>En1</b> expressed?</li>
  <li>What genes are expressed in the heart at E8.5 in wild-type mice only?</li>
  <li>Is <b>Htr7</b> expressed in the brain?</li>
  <li>What members of the Wnt gene family are expressed in TS 16?</li>
  <li>When and where are genes involved in axon guidance expressed?</li>
  <li>What genes have been shown NOT to be expressed in either the diencephalon or any structure within the diencephalon?</li>
  <li>What genes involved in cell adhesion are expressed in stomach mesenchyme?</li>
  <!--<li>What transcription factors located on chromosome 1 have been found to be expressed in the forelimb?</li>-->
 </ul>
<p>(See <A href="#example">Are there examples of query results?</a> for the form
field values for these queries.)
<p>
If you are interested in doing queries that ask what genes are expressed in some anatomical structures and/or developmental stages but not in others, you should use the Differential Expression Search tab on this form.</p>

<p><b>Nomenclature search.</b> Use the left hand field to search for expression data for a mouse gene or set of genes with a similar nomenclature. 
<ul>
<li>The gene nomenclature field supports an asterisk as a wild card. A search for pax* finds expression data for gene symbols and names that begin with <i>pax</i>.</li>
<li>A search for *box* looks for nomenclature that contains <i>box</i>. This search finds the arginine decarboxylase gene, homeobox genes and paired box genes.</li>
<li>A search for <i>growth factor</i> finds nomenclature containing <i>growth</i> AND <i>factor</i>.</li>
<li>Synonyms (unofficial gene names used in publications and former official gene symbols) are also searched.</li>
<li>This field searches only alphanumeric characters. Single and double quotes, commas and hyphens are ignored.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>Vocabulary term search.</b> Use the right hand field to find expression data for genes defined by their function, phenotype or disease model association.<!--, protein domain or family, or biological pathway.--> 
<ul>
<li>Begin typing a term of interest and an autocomplete list activates on the second character. 
    <ul>
    <li>The list shows all the vocabulary terms and their synonyms that match your search characters (shown in bold letters) and the number of genes annotated to each term.</li>
    <li>Terms are greyed out if there are no genes annotated to the term or if there are no expression data associated with the genes.</li>
    <li>You can type the beginnings of multiple terms to narrow the list (example: axon guid).
    </ul>
<li>You must select a term. There is no free text searching in this field.</li>
<li>You can only select one term, though choosing a term includes results for its subterms. For example, selecting <i>decreased bone mass</i> also includes results for its subterms, decreased compact bone mass, decreased trabecular bone mass and osteoporosis.</li>
<li>The autocomplete field ignores non-alphanumeric characters such as " and -.</li>

You must choose a term from the autocomplete list (i.e., there is no free text entry in this field).</p>

<P>For each developmental stage, the Anatomical Dictionary is organized as a hierarchy of structures. <!--You can choose to include either substructures (children), superstructures (parents), both, or neither in your search.--> By default, the search includes substructures. This means if you search for gene expression in, for example, brain, this searches for all terms that contain the word <i>brain</i> and the substructures to those terms in the hierarchy, such as rhombencephalon, tectum and others.</p>
<!--<ul>
<li>
If you enter more than one structure in the query field, you can choose to find data for genes that match ALL specified structures (the default value). In this case, the commas are interpreted to mean "and" &#151; your query returns assays that examine the expression of genes for which <b>all</b> of the specified structures have been analyzed. </li>
<li>If you choose to find data for genes that match ANY specified structures, the query interprets the commas to mean "or" and returns assays that examine the expression of genes for which <b>any</b> of the specified structures have been analyzed.</li>
</ul>
<p> If you choose to include superstructures, the system, besides searching for brain, looks for structures in the hierarchy placed above brain, such as central nervous system. This can be a useful search strategy when you want to know in what structures a gene is NOT expressed.</p>-->

<p><a name="stages"></a><b>Note</b>: The Theiler system organizes development into stages defined by the
appearance of specific developmental features. Embryos of the same gestational age can vary considerably with respect to development.  Consequently, a Theiler stage does not precisely correspond to a particular age. For example, TS 21 applies to embryos between 12.5 and 14.0 days post conception (dpc), while TS 22 applies to embryos between 13.5 and 15.0 dpc.</p>
To select multiple stages or ages: 
<UL>
  <LI>On a Macintosh, hold the command (Apple, &#8984;) key down and click on the desired stages; OR hold the shift key down and  click on two stages to select those and all stages in between. </li>
  <LI>On a PC, hold the control key down and click on the desired stages; OR hold the shift key down and click on two stages to select those and all stages in between. </li>
 </UL>
<p>If you mouse-over a stage, a pop-up will describe a few defining features of that stage, such as "first somites, late head fold" for Stage 12.

<h3><a name="whatdiffer"></a>What is the purpose of the Differential Expression Search?</h3>
<p>The Differential Expression Search is specifically designed to allow you to search for genes expressed in some anatomical structures or developmental stages but not in others. Examples of the questions you can ask are:
 <UL>
  <LI>Which genes are expressed in the forebrain and not expressed in the midbrain?</LI>
  <!--<LI>Which genes are expressed exclusively in the eye and its substructures?</LI>-->
  <LI>Which genes are expressed only at Theiler Stage 15?</LI>
  <LI>Which genes are expressed at Theiler Stage 10 but either are not expressed or have not been analyzed in the adult?</LI>
  </UL></p>

</p>
<a href="#top"><font size="-1">Top</font></a>

<h3><a name="revise"></a>Can I edit my original options and requery?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<ul><li>If you want to edit a list or change output options:</li>
<ol>
  <li>When your results appear, click the banner at the top of the page (<b>Click to modify search</b>). (The banner title  changes to <b>Click to hide search</b>.) The window that appears contains your original search criteria. </li>
  <li>Make your changes.</li>
  <li>Click Search.</li>
  <li>Repeat until the desired results appear.</li>

<ul>
<li>You can requery as many times as you like.</li>
<li>If you had <a href="#gxdfilter">filtered</a> your search results, when you modify your search, the filters are automatically applied to your modified results.</li>
<li>Alternatively, click Reset to return to the original Gene Expression Data Query form. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<a href="#top"><font size="-1">Top</font></a>

<h3><a name="gxdfilter"></a>How do I filter my results?</h3>
<p>You can filter results by Anatomical System, Assay Type, Theiler Stage, or by whether expression was Detected or whether the data are for Wild type or mutant specimens. In the banner above your results, after <i>Filter expression data by:</i> click the desired box. This will reduce your results to only those containing the checked items. The filters are applied across all data tabs and to any file you <a href="#excelfile_gxdqf">export</a>. If you reached this page by using the Gene Expression Data Query form, then if you <a href="#revise">modify</a> your search, the filters are automatically applied to your modified results.</p>
<p>Both Matrix tabs offer easy filtering by tissue, and the Tissue x Stage Matrix also offers filtering by developmental stage/age and the Tissue x Gene Matrix permits filtering by gene symbol. Check the rows or columns you wish to retain and then click the blue filter icon in the grid to apply the filters. These filters are also applied to all tabs.</p>

<h4><a name="tissuematrix"></a>Tissue x Stage Matrix</h4>
<p>If you select the Tissue x Stage Matrix, the query summary presents the query results as a grid view. The columns show developmental, Theiler, stages (TS) where expression was examined and the rows display the tissues that were examined. the rows display the tissues that were examined. Theiler stages are defined using morphological criteria, not gestational age.  Therefore, although the column headers also display the gestational ages over which each developmental stage may be found, these ages are not used as the search criteria. For example, TS4 represents the blastocyst stage; it is not an composite of results from all of our E2-4 specimens. The Theiler Stages are further defined <a href="http://www.emouseatlas.org/emap/ema/theiler_stages/StageDefinition/stagedefinition.html">here</a>. The tissues consist of high level anatomy terms from the <a href="VOCAB_mad_browser_help.shtml">The Mouse Developmental Anatomy Ontology</a>. You can expand or collapse the anatomy hierarchy by clicking on the blue &#9658; or &#9660;.</p>
<p>In addition to the page-wide <a href="#gxdfilter">filters</a>, you can also filter the grid by checking rows and/or columns and clicking the blue filter icon to reduce the grid to just the rows and columns you have checked.</p>

<h4><a name="genematrix"></a>Tissue x Gene Matrix</h4>
<p>If you select the Tissue x Gene Matrix, the query summary presents the results as a grid view. The columns show genes whose expression was examined and the rows display the tissues that were examined.  The tissues consist of high level anatomy terms from the <a href="VOCAB_mad_browser_help.shtml">The Mouse Developmental Anatomy Ontology</a>. You can expand or collapse the anatomy hierarchy by clicking on the blue &#9658; or &#9660;.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#gxdfilter">filters</a> above the tabs, you can also filter by checking rows and/or columns in the grid and clicking on the blue filter icon to reduce the grid to just the rows and columns you have checked. Selected filters will be displayed above the tab; they can be removed by clicking on them.  Any filtering done on the grid will apply to all the other data tabs as well.</p>

<h3><a name="matrixcolors"></a>What do the colors in a Matrix mean?</h3>
<p>The colors in the grid, <strong style="background-color: #D7E4FF; color:#000; font-size:12px;">blues</strong> for expression detected and <strong style="background-color:#FF6767; color:#000; font-size:12px;">reds</strong> for expression not detected</strong>, get progressively darker when there are more supporting annotations. The darker colors do not denote higher or lower levels of expression, just more evidence. <strong style="background-color: #BFBFBF; color:#000; font-size:12px;">Grey</strong> squares indicate the only annotations for the tissue are ones for which the researchers examined the tissue but did not definitively state whether expression was present or absent, i.e. their description was ambiguous. 
Squares with a <strong style="background-color:#FF6767; color:#000; font-size:12px;">red</strong> corner indicate that expression has been reported as being both present and absent in that tissue. Although this may be because different labs made conflicting observations, it may also be due to other factors, such as differences in the genotype or sex of the specimen, sensitivity of the assay used, or a difference in the transcript variant assayed.
A square with a <strong style="background-color: #FADD6D; color:#000; font-size:12px;">gold</strong> corner indicates that although there are no annotations where expression was reported as being present in either the tissue or its substructures, there are expression results for substructures of the tissue that were reported as being either absent or ambiguous.</p>
<p>A circle in a square (found only in the Tissue x Stage Matrix) indicates the tissue exists at that Theiler stage but we have no expression data for it, whereas a blank square indicates that the tissue does not exist at that stage.</p>
<p>Clicking in any box in the grid will open a dialogue box. For <strong style="background-color: #D7E4FF; color:#000; font-size:12px;">blue</strong> squares, this box will indicate the number of annotations where expression was reported as being present in either the tissue or its substructures.  It may also indicate additional expression results annotated to this tissue that were reported as being either absent or ambiguous; absent or ambiguous annotations to substructures will not be reported. For <strong style="background-color:#FF6767; color:#000; font-size:12px;">red</strong> squares, this box will indicate the number of annotations where expression was reported as being absent in the tissue; annotations to substructures will not be reported.  For <strong style="background-color: #BFBFBF; color:#000; font-size:12px;">grey</strong> squares, this box will indicate the number of annotations to the tissue where the expression levels were reported in an ambiguous fashion.  It may also indicate additional expression results annotated to this tissue that were reported as being absent.  In neither case will absent and/or ambiguous annotations to substructures be reported.  Since squares with a <strong style="background-color: #FADD6D; color:#000; font-size:12px;">gold</strong> corner indicate that all the expression results are absent or ambiguous annotations to substructures, the number of annotations is not indicated in the dialogue box. In all cases, clicking “View These Results” will take you to the assay results tab where these results can be reviewed in detail.  If there are annotations where expression was reported as being absent or ambiguous in a substructure, they will be shown on this tab (although they will not be included in the counts on the dialogue box).  Clicking “View the Images” will take you to the images tab. </p>

<h3><a name="excelfile_gxdqf"></a>Can I get my results as tab-delimited text or spreadsheet files?</h3>
<p>Yes. The <a href="#genestab">Genes</a> and <a href="#assaytab">Assay Results</a> tabs but not the others, provide export options. In your search results, click on the Text File or Excel File icon. Your web browser will download a file of the results<!-- that remain after any filtering you may have performed-->.</p>

<font size="-1"><A HREF="#top">Top</A></font>

<h3><A name="batch"></a>Can I send the results of my search to the MGI Batch Query?</h3>
<p>Yes. Under the Genes tab you have the option of exporting your results as a text file, spreadsheet file or sending the list of genes to the MGI Batch Query. If you click the Batch Query icon, the default Batch Summary will appear for your list of genes. Use the Click to modify search button to expand your search results to include additional information such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms, Mammalian Phenotype (MP) terms or Human Diseases associated with the genes.</p>
<p>See also <a href="BATCH_help.shtml"target="_blank">Using the MGI Batch Query</a>.</p>

<h3>What if the search does not find any expression results?</h3>
<p>See <a href="EXPRESSION_query_results_help.shtml#not_found" target="_blank">Interpreting Gene Expression Data Query Results</a>.
</p>
<a href="#top"><font size="-1">Top</font></a>

<h3><a name="gxd_lit_record"></a>Why is there a link to Gene Expression Literature records in my query summary?</h3>
<p>At the end of the query summary, there may be a link to Gene Expression Literature content records matching the parameters of your detailed expression data search.  
<ul>
  <li>The first step of annotation in GXD is to create literature content records containing information on the genes and ages analyzed and assay types used in each reference. All expression papers have content records. </li>
  <li>The next step is for the curators to extract the detailed expression data from these references. The types of data annotated at this stage include:  the anatomical structures analyzed; the authors' description of the pattern and strength of expression; and the genetic origin of the sample. Because annotation process is time-consuming, not all expression references have detailed data in the database. </li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p> Thus, to ensure that your query returns all the references of interest to you, searches of the detailed expression data also include searches of the literature content records (whenever query parameters apply to both these types of data). <a href="#gxdfilter">Filtering</a> your query summary will not affect the number of literature records returned, whereas <a href="#revise">modifying</a> your query will.</p>

<h3><a name="generate"></a>Which expression data query parameters generate an expression literature search? Which do not?</h3>
<p>The following detailed expression data query parameters generate an expression literature search:
<ul>
  <li>gene symbol/name </li>
  <!--<li>map position</li>-->
  <li>function, phenotype or disease term</li>
  <li>developmental stage</li>
  <li>assay type.</li>
</ul>
   
<p>Because of the limited annotation of content records, the following parameters do not generate an expression literature search:
<ul>
  <li>anatomical structure</li>
  <li>detected in (expression present)</li>
  <li>not detected in (expression absent)</li>
  <li>mutated gene symbol/name.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
   
<p><b>Note:</b> You can query gene expression literature content records directly using the 
<a href="<!--#include file='include/fewi_url.html'-->gxdlit" target="_blank">Gene Expression Literature Query Form</a>.</p>
