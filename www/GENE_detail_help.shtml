			<tr><th>Transcription Start Sites</th><td>Transcription Start Site (TSS) features for the gene, linked to their Detail pages. A link for all the TSS leads to a pop-up menu showing the coordinates for the TSS region and the distance from gene's 5'-end in bp. A minus number (e.g., -27 bp) means the midpoint of the TSS region is upstream of the gene's start site. A positive number (e.g., 127 bp) means the start site for the TSS region is downstream of the gene's start site. TSS features are from the functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project. 
			FANTOM5 performed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) across 399 mouse samples, including primary cells, tissues and cancer cell lines. See: "A promoter-level mammalian expression atlas." <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13182" target="_blank">Nature</a>. 2014. 507: 462â€“470. The pop-up window generated by selecting the link offers the option to "View in JBrowse." 
			This will display a graphic view of the TSS features and the gene. JBrowse is an NHGRI funded genome browser that is used by MGI, the Alliance of Genome Resources, and several other model organism databases. </td>
